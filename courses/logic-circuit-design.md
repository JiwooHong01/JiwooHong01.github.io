#### Course Information

[Course Outline]
Have you wondered how computer works internally?
While that is a very difficult one, this course will help you make a very first step towards answering it.
We start from transistors -- which is an electrical switch -- to gradually build up logic gates, computing blocks, memories, and sequential logic
until we are ready to study the very prinitve form of a CPU at the heart of computers.
You will have several homeworks and projects as well which is supposed to strengthen your understanding if you conduct them well.
